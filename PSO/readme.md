# PSO with animated simulation in Python 
Particle Swarm Optimization with animated simulation in Python, tested to Ackley and Rosenbrock functions.  

## Simulation
To simulate optimization, run `$python pso.py`
Here, two examples of function being optimized
#### Ackley function
Global minimum at (0,0) with value of 0

#### Rosenbrock function
Global minimum at (1,1) with value of 0
