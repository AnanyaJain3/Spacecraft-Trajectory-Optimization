Exploring the vast expanse of our universe requires innovation, precision and accuracy along with a deep understanding of the complex dynamics, laws that govern the movement of spacecraft. Spacecraft trajectories are the heart of every successful space mission, be it interplanetary exploration, rendezvous with celestial bodies, or even navigating around space stations and satellites.The ability to chart optimal trajectory paths for these vessels as they traverse the cosmic sea is of paramount significance in the field of space exploration. Over the years, scientists and engineers together have delved into the delicacies of spacecraft trajectory planning, seeking solutions that guarantee safe passage and also optimize fuel consumption along with minimizing the total mission time. Through the combined report, we embark on a journey through the astounding advancements in spacecraft trajectory planning and optimization.

The realm of space exploration is witnessing a strong revolution in computational methods thanks to the ever growing technologies and methods developed like application of hybrid algorithms combining swarm optimization with Legendre pseudospectral methods to tackle complex time-optimal trajectory planning, implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for automated interplanetary mission planning. These methods hold the potential to revolutionize how we plan and execute missions in the cosmic void.

We also explored innovative approaches which promised increased efficiency and helped us cover a larger area for the future. Methods such as Direct-Adaptive Model Predictive Control (DAMPC), which combines adaptive and optimal control systems to navigate through asteroid-rich regions, and Genetic Algorithms (GA) for optimizing low-thrust interplanetary trajectories.

Spacecraft trajectory optimization is a multidisciplinary field that touches upon mathematics, physics, and computer science. It required a delicate balance between mathematical modeling, heuristic search algorithms, and real-world engineering constraints.Whether it was steering through the gravitational fields of celestial bodies or avoiding collisions in the vastness of space. Spacecraft trajectory optimization poses a diverse range of profound challenges. As we ventured further into the cosmos, the pursuit of optimal spacecraft trajectories became not only a scientific endeavor but also a testament to human curiosity and also to our unquenchable thirst for exploration. The report helps in solving the mysteries of space with an intricate web of algorithms, models and simulations that guide humanity's quest to reach the stars and beyond. In the pages that follow in this report, we have dived deep into the methods and technologies that make these wild journeys possible.


Some goals we try to achieve from this is to have a working model, expressed as an executable code, which can predict, estimate and do similar tasks.

We will be looking at various algorithms to help us in our venture. The study of spacecraft trajectories is a multifaceted field that strives to optimize the paths of space missions with a diverse range of objectives and constraints of the cosmic world. It will be evident from the provided papers that researchers have made significant progress in developing advanced optimization techniques, adaptive control systems, and collision avoidance strategies to enhance the efficiency and safety of space exploration.

The application of computational methods, such as Genetic Algorithms and Monte Carlo Tree Search, has enabled the solution of complex trajectory planning problems, while the integration of mathematical models and consideration of uncertainties are pivotal for precise and accurate navigation. Furthermore we will see the emphasis on multi-objective optimization and the accomplishment of mission goals with minimal fuel consumption underscore the ongoing efforts to extend the reach and capabilities of space missions. Overall, the research presented in the report showcases the dedication and passion of scientists and engineers together in advancing the field of spacecraft trajectories to unlock the mysteries of the cosmos and enable ambitious human interplanetary probes.
